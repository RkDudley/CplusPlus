C++ Projects

The projects of a book store demonstrate how to use data structure of list, queue and stack. I teamed up with 3 of my class mate 
to create this project. It is a first project that we have to build from a ground. I was really excited to create this project
We separated three part to work together. Each of us will create at least two classes and followed project descriptive to use all 
of requirement which consisted of 

1. Using data structure list queue and stack
2. Use algortihm of link list and array base list
3. composition and inheritance 
4. Compile and readable 

My part is customer classes. I decided to define a link list implementation becuase the customer can grow, link list is a best option to
implement those 2 classes.

The first image is showing a main menu which my friend created, to go to my function that I implemeneted press No 3 client information.
It displays an option to manage membership at a book store which is consisted of add,delete,edit, search and display option.

The first procedure that I approched is creating an UML. UML is an object oriented diagram using to picuture which member object and method will be used in a project.

The CustomerType class is an operation.
