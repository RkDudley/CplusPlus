C++ Exercise
The following c++ coding projects are my showcase of my learning process, showing a skills how I can absort a material and 
techinques from a class. 

The first project is called "perimeter box calculation." It is strightforward to show how to use varaiable, arithmetic operator 
for calculation and output the program from a screen.

The second project showed how I can use a pointer and an array. I created a function to display the value of an array as well as display the value in order from an index.

I declared double val as a pointer parameter argument. A pointer is a memory address which can point to any variable that we assigned.
The reason I use a pointer in this program is bacuase scope. I couldn't return a value to a main function if I pass only a value. 
The local variable will return 0 and all the output will be 0 which is not correct outcome that I want. 

I use for-loop to iterate over an array, and display each value once it is loop to each element. 

Asterisk before variable name is represent the value of an array *(val+1) is show the vaule each array element. 

The third project is Counting a same letter from a string

This project is a practice how to use a string and an array. In a function serach, I pass a parameter by reference and const.
Recall const keyword before decalre varaible means the value can't change. This case, I protect a string variable from a main function
not to be able to change.
